# BankAccount
This Java program simulates a simple Bank Account Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It allows users to deposit, withdraw, check balance, and view account details through a menu-driven console interface.
The project demonstrates key OOP principles such as encapsulation, constructors, and methods, making it an ideal beginner-friendly Java application for understanding real-world object modeling.
